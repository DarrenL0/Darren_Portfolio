                            Level up is a fitness app that will provide users with the essential tools to train 
                            in the most efficient ways. The app will allow users to track their progress and set
                            up programs that they can follow. The app’s goal is to provide more than just fitness
                            functions, as it strives to motivate users through a progress system unique to the app.
                            The progress system mimics a game-like scenario where each user has a level. Through completion 
                            of their fitness programs and daily tasks set by the app, the users can gain experience points to level up.

                            For this project we designed a low-fidelity prototype to create a visual design and illustrate the
                             key elements for our application. This allowed the team to start a discussion on our vision and improvement
                              towards the design. Furthermore, the team created a medium fidelity design for each functionality to convey
                               tests with users in the usability and observe how they would interact with our application, which allowed the team to improve the design.

                            As this was under a time constraint some functionality was not implemented due to poor management.
                             Next time we could have adopted agile methodology to ensure we prioritise tasks with higher difficulty
                             to ensure all functions are implemented. Additionally, the design aspect was much more difficult to tackle
                              within our time frame, and more time should have been dedicated to learning the technology.
