                    <h1>Hitch</h1>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Project overview</h3>

                        <h4>Design problem</h4>
                        <p>
                            The aim of the project is to develop a car sharing service that will allow users to place their
                            cars on the market and allow consumers to rent their cars for the advertised price. The project
                            aims to alleviate the high cost of renting cars from car rental companies and offers an
                            alternative option that will also allow those who have a car but seldom use it, to make a profit.

                            The main objectives that the project team will attempt to meet are to produce a car sharing
                            platform that has a well designed UI, suitable functionality for the users to use as well as an
                            efficient and rigid product to ensure the customer can enjoy a speedy service that is available
                            all the time. Maintainability of the system is also important to make sure that the system will
                            be easily updatable without massively changing core system components that might affect
                            how the system functions as well as introducing bugs.

                            Hitch is an innovative idea that stems from very successful platforms such as Uber, a taxi
                            ordering mobile application or AirBnb, a house rental web application. Our team was inspired
                            by their innovative design to help the global population to efficiently provide to their target
                            audience. As Hitch is a platform that is similar to a car rental company, it will be widely
                            popular to tourists and adventurous people that like road tripping without the worries of
                            damaging their car. A key factor to sponsor Hitch is due to the fact that covid has prevented
                            traveling in many states thus once the pandemic crisis are over people will be looking for
                            traveling opportunities, where the demand for a travel car would be inconceivable. Thus, Hitch
                            would come into place to resolve their problem. Furthermore, Hitch will be designed with the
                            mindset of potential growth and become mainstream in a global market.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Design approach</h4>
                        <p>
                            The group will be delivering the project following Agile and Scrum methodology.
                            This methodology encompasses teams to learn through experience, reflect and make 
                            continuous improvements. Which for us students is the most important aspect as any
                             skills we can pick up will be a great asset in our careers as a developer.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Team</h4>
                        <p>The project consisted of a team of 5 members:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>-&nbsp;One member focused on frontend designed</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;Three members were assigned backend role</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;One member was assigned to unit testing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Role</h4>
                        <p>
                            I was appointed project leader and scrum master for this project.
                             My task consisted of overseeing the teamâ€™s progress and planning 
                             accordingly to ensure our project met the deadline. Furthermore,  
                             maintaining sprint documents, recording meeting minutes and discussing
                              our progress with our client. I was also part of the backend development 
                              team, my main role was to implement cloud services from amazon web service to our project.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Tools</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>-&nbsp;Trello</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;Github</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;Google drive</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;Amazon web service</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;Digital ocean</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;MySQL</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Stakeholders and end user</h4>
                        <p>
                            The team determined the project's stakeholder and end user before the development
                             of the project. As we found it crucial to understand our target audience to achieve a
                              user-centered design project. As our project is a car sharing service targeting the tourism demographic,
                               it was required for the application to have a secured payment system and a gps location service functionality. 
                        </p>

                        <h4>User stories</h4>
                        <p>
                            As this project follows agile methodology, we created user stories to aid in the development of our project.
                             We created a trello board to add our product backlog and sprint backlog. It was beneficial for the group to create 
                             user stories before the development phase as it painted the picture on what functionality we are creating. Furthermore, 
                             as this project was under a limited time constraint, by prioritising user stories with higher difficulty we were able to 
                             avoid wasting time and failing to meet the deadline. 
                        </p>

                        <img src="assets/img/Hitch/Hitch_system_architecture.png">
                        
                        <h4>User flow [Task flow]</h4>

                        <p>
                            A user flow, specifically the task flow was created to depict how a single task
                             is performed by the user. This allows the team to visualise the process of how 
                             the user interacts with our functionality. This also ensures our functionality is
                              implemented fully by cross checking with our diagram to see if the task flow matches.  
                        </p>

                        <h4>Entity relationship diagram</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our team created an entity relationship diagram to provide 
                            a visual representation of our data objects. This diagram aided us in 
                            converting our model into a hierarchical data within the database.
                        </p>

                        <h4>User acceptance test</h4>
                        <p>
                            User acceptance test was written to help improve our software quality. 
                            Furthermore, it is a fast and cheap way to test the usability and functionality 
                            of our project, allowing us to discover issues early on. On the other hand it can 
                            also provide feedback on additional improvement to our software.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Wireframe was generated for our functionality for this project before implementation, 
                            to provide a clear visual structure of our project. Whatâ€™s more it clarifies the features
                             of the interface, to provide a better usability experience and help refine our design process.
