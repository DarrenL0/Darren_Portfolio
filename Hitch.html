                        <p class="project__description">
                            The aim of the project is to develop a car sharing service that will allow users to place their
                            cars on the market and allow consumers to rent their cars for the advertised price. The project
                            aims to alleviate the high cost of renting cars from car rental companies and offers an
                            alternative option that will also allow those who have a car but seldom use it, to make a profit.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="sub__heading">Design approach</h3>
                        <p class="project__description">
                            The group will be delivering the project following Agile and Scrum methodology.
                            This methodology encompasses teams to learn through experience, reflect and make 
                            continuous improvements. Which for us students is the most important aspect as any
                             skills we can pick up will be a great asset in our careers as a developer.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="sub__heading">Team</h3>
                        <p>The project consisted of a team of 5 members:</p>
                        <ul class="project__description">
                            <li>-&nbsp;One member focused on frontend designed</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;Three members were assigned backend role</li>
                            <li>-&nbsp;One member was assigned to unit testing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="sub__heading">Role</h3>
                        <p class="project__description">
                            I was appointed project leader and scrum master for this project.
                             My task consisted of overseeing the teamâ€™s progress and planning 
                             accordingly to ensure our project met the deadline. Furthermore,  
                             maintaining sprint documents, recording meeting minutes and discussing
                              our progress with our client. I was also part of the backend development 
                              team, my main role was to implement cloud services from amazon web service to our project.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="sub__heading">Tools</h3>

                        <h3 class="sub__heading">Stakeholders and end user</h3>
                        <p class="project__description">
                            The team determined the project's stakeholder and end user before the development
                             of the project. As we found it crucial to understand our target audience to achieve a
                              user-centered design project. As our project is a car sharing service targeting the tourism demographic,
                               it was required for the application to have a secured payment system and a gps location service functionality. 
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="sub__heading">User stories</h3>
                        <p class="project__description">
                            As this project follows agile methodology, we created user stories to aid in the development of our project.
                             We created a trello board to add our product backlog and sprint backlog. It was beneficial for the group to create 
                             user stories before the development phase as it painted the picture on what functionality we are creating. Furthermore, 
                             as this project was under a limited time constraint, by prioritising user stories with higher difficulty we were able to 
                             avoid wasting time and failing to meet the deadline. 
                        </p>

                            A user flow, specifically the task flow was created to depict how a single task
                             is performed by the user. This allows the team to visualise the process of how 
                             the user interacts with our functionality. This also ensures our functionality is
                              implemented fully by cross checking with our diagram to see if the task flow matches.

                            Our team created an entity relationship diagram to provide 
                            a visual representation of our data objects. This diagram aided us in 
                            converting our model into a hierarchical data within the database.

                            of our project, allowing us to discover issues early on. On the other hand it can 
                            also provide feedback on additional improvement to our software.
